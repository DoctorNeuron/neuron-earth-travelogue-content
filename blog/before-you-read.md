My travel blog has something to address. Take this as a FAQ before you read my blog.

## üçî Food Review

I am focused on my food, so here are some symbols you need to know.

### üöø Hygiene

This is a metric of how clean and sterile the place and the food is. In lament terms:
* 9 or 10‚≠ê: Exceptionally sterile. The workers are wearing their PPE, no unnecessary waste near the kitchen, the tableware and utensils are shining clean, table is always cleaned before sitting in.
* 8‚≠ê: Sterile. Might not wear complete PPE, but it is comfortable and has a clean environment and strict regulations.
* 7‚≠ê: Follows standard common sense protocol. Guaranteed to be clean and comfortable for 98% of people. A closed kitchen has a greater chance of gaining this point.
* 6 or 5‚≠ê: You might need to clean your table and equipment thoroughly.
* 4‚≠ê: Expect a smelly odor or some uninvited guests.
* 3 to 1‚≠ê: Total havoc. No hygiene protocol was set or enforced. It also somehow affects the food.
* 0‚≠ê: Don't bother eating there. Safety is your number one priority.

### üòÉ Service

This is a metric on how the employees are treating their guests or customers. See the lament meaning of the ratings below.
* 10‚≠ê: Reserved for high-end restaurants. The waitress doesn't bother to explain the menu. They might even give you an introduction before eating. Personally, no common restaurant will gain this rating.
* 9‚≠ê: You are really above a common guest. You get special treatment like an introduction on ordering or you can pay your bills on your table. Exceptionally great but applicable if the waitress doesn't go through paragraphs of essays per order.
* 8‚≠ê: The waitress knows the details of your order and can convey them clearly to your ears. They have no problem answering your detailed question. Very disciplined and always ready for service.
* 7‚≠ê: **This is the default value if I somehow did not give them a rating**. Most of the places I go are getting this rating. It follows a standard protocol of being an actual waitress. Disciplined and have the required knowledge of their job desks and menus. Always ready whenever needed.
* 6 to 5‚≠ê: The waitress might have a bit of trouble with attitude. Might be uneasy on normal occasions (a manageable amount of guests need to be served or not in an intense situation). This includes uncomfortable language or uneasy intonation.
* 4 to 1‚≠ê: This will depend on how many rude and unacceptable behaviors are committed and how severe are they. This will be subjective to others, nevertheless, the common indicators are yelling for a small mistake, very long waiting time, indiscipline behavior, inadequate training, and others.
* 0‚≠ê: Karen's Dinner unstaged or worst üíÄ

### üõí Worthiness

This is a metric on the worthiness of your food per quantity. Here is a subjective breakdown per rating.
* 10‚≠ê: Worth your penny so much that you can make this a daily staple and still have money to spend on other things.
* 9 to 8‚≠ê: Good product as self-reward and you can enjoy this with no guilt about pricetag.
* 7‚≠ê: Worth your buck still for once or twice per month and no more.
* 6 to 4‚≠ê: Maybe once in a lifetime is ok just to satisfy your curiosity.
* 3 to 0‚≠ê: Just pretend the product is not there.

### ‚ú® Taste

This will also be a subjective rating and should be taken with a grain of salt. You can also skip this rating from me if you wish. I have my likes and dislikes, so do not try me at the internet court.
* 10‚≠ê: So awesome. Eleganto. Umai. Oishi. Enak banget. Marvelous. etc... I will dream of eating this again and again and I will do anything for another chance
* 9‚≠ê: I am hoping for another chance. I can eat this every time and will not get tired of it.
* 8‚≠ê: Hoping for another chance still, yet for a longer period (once or twice a month)
* 7‚≠ê: Just another good food for my lunch. Will order again if somehow I want to.
* 6 to 5‚≠ê: This might be okay for another attempt. There are many better options outside. Lower than expectation. Condiments cannot help either.
* 4 to 2‚≠ê: Will never eat this slime again. Disgusting. Will not even try to take a second sip or scoop.
* 1‚≠ê: Will not even want to taste. Even the smell will make me sick ü§Æ.
* 0‚≠ê: Inedible. Health hazard üíÄ. Call the health inspector ASAP üöë! Evacuate the place IMMEDIATELY ‚ò¢
!

### üí∞ Tax

This indicates how much tax (in percentage) they are charging you outside of the food price. In other words, the tax is not included in your food price. No tax means tax included.

### üõë Warning

This contains a warning if you have some kind of restriction on your diet. Usually, I will tell here if this product contains pig, alcohol, or has an exotic product (frogs or snakes for example).
