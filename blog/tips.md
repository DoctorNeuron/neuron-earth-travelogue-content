# Travel tips... from a newbie local ordinary person

Okay okay if you need a serious tip for your next big travel, you should skip this reading and find a new article.

So, this is a compilation of what I did learn from my previous tip that will help me (and might be you).

## 1. Itinerary

In short, plan where will you go and when. From my experience, the longer the distance you are from home, the more meticulous you need to plan as you have to maximize your time as much as possible.

For short-distance travel, you can just scour Google Maps and look at your favorite social media. Make sure to go to more than 1 place. I cannot stand inside one place for my entire day of travel.

Honestly, I never do solo long-distance travel before, so this section will be updated.

## 2. Food

For the love of heaven, please never go eat at big-branded restaurants. Try their street food. Try their unique cuisine. It might be hit-or-miss but life is about a chance, bois ðŸ˜Š.

## 3. Transportation

I love to talk about this part. Make sure to research deeply about transportation methods. I don't recommend you to take Ub-r. Be like locals! Take their public transport.
