# We are going a bit further... for a while

Hello and welcome to my first blog. In a sudden unplanned trip, I was going a bit further from Jakarta. Afterwards, I went back for new places I had to discover myself. Enjoy this messy blog ðŸ˜Š.

## 09:10

### Packing my things

I packed my things first. Usually, I bring my lappy as if I want to do my work outside hopefully hehe. This time, I am not doing that since I want to go a bit further from my province.

I brought nothing special with me. Just a phone, some bucks in case I cannot pay digitally, a tumbler with water, an umbrella, and my notebook in case I want to draw something.

## 09:11 - 09:30

### Juanda Train Station

My initial plan was for me to step foot on Universitas Indonesia and Margo City. They are situated in Depok. I never went to another university other than my university (take a guess hehe).

To go there, I have to go to Juanda Station and take a train to Pondok Cina Station. Before that, I have to transport myself to Juanda Station.
You only have to take a Transjakarta, an integrated busway system in Jakarta. It is super affordable (3500 IDR) and you can go from East to West with the same price tag. No strings attached.

I took a direct route using the 8th corridor from my place to Juanda bus station. After that, I directly went to the Juanda Train Station.

It is super easy to get in. You can use your prepaid cards (Fla\*\* for example). For Juanda to Pondok Cina, I cannot remember the price, but somewhere between 3K to 5K IDR.

### Pondok Cina, Danau Kenanga, Universitas Indonesia

At last, Pondok Cina ðŸŽ‰!

The first step, I went inside Universitas Indonesia. I was interested of the famous lake, **Danau Kenanga**. The trip was 3 minutes long since the station exit is a step away from UI's entrance.

I want to say that this area is so large that they even have a busway system called Bikun (Bis Kuning, Yellow Bus). I don't take one so I can see things that might interest me, but for curious non-students there, this bus, as far as I know, is **open to the public and it is FREE.**
![Look, they even have a bus for transportation](../../../images/2024/january/20/2-1.jpg)

Here is a quote from Ki Hajar Dewantara, our national hero in education and the first Indonesian Minister of Education. Neuron is here for a motivational quote. `Everywhere is your school and everyone is your teacher`.
![Everywhere is your school and everyone is your teacher](../../../images/2024/january/20/2-2.jpg)

A bit of a trip from the entrance, and I was here ðŸ˜Ž. Look at that majestic transparent water. It is a part of a conservation effort. No fishing and no swimming there, but why would you swim freely inside a campus area lol.

![Kenanga Lake 3](../../../images/2024/january/20/2-5.jpg)

I was walking around the campus and I saw a Batagor hawker. It is crowded with buyers so I was curious about their batagor. They also sell parai (bitter squash) and others. I only bought their batagor for a small portion. 5K to be exact and I was regretting my decision.

It is yummy as I was trying it. They have a thin yet crispy coating. The fish is also a real fish as I can taste the fish well. It is chewy in a good way. They also put a generous amount of peanut sauce. I admit that the sauce is a bit too salty, yet it is tolerable, so I digress.

### Brunch

![UI Library](../../../images/2024/january/20/3-1.jpg)
![What is that? It is gorgeous](../../../images/2024/january/20/3-2.jpg)
Next, I headed to their library. Once again, it is open to the public and I was roaming inside and ended on their canteen. I hadn't had my breakfast, so I order a meal as my brunch because it was almost 11:00.

I ordered a plate of kebuli rice (sorta like pilaf) with grilled chicken. I can say that it's a bargain and it is worth my 22K IDR.

![A plate of kebuli rice with grilled chicken](../../../images/2024/january/20/3-3.jpg)
The rice is tasty. I am able to taste their herbs and the hardness of the rice grain is in a goldilock spot from my compass. Ionly smell the fragrance if I get a bit closer, nevertheless, the appearance is just enough to wake up my appetite.

![Grilled chicken](../../../images/2024/january/20/3-4.jpg)
Chicken is also aromatic and tasty although might be too stiff for a plate of kebuli since the chicken is supposed to be more tender than your plate of normal grilled chicken. It is tolerable and I enjoyed it.

The chili sauce is... ok I guess? I cannot taste the spiciness at all. I am not a spicy addict and I cannot handle too much spiciness.

I think this picture can summarize my overall impression.

## 11:00 - 11:30
### Another trip inside UI campus

After brunch, I had to burn some of the calories, so in a typical Neuron fashion, I traveled around the campus area with no real destination. Here is a montage of my random trip around.

## 11:30
### Outside

My trip was done here. My next stop was Margo City Mall. It is very close to UI with 15 minutes of walking. After crossing the rails, I was passing the narrow strip of road. Left and right was full of food stalls selling mostly foods and drinks (mostly sweet jasmine tea).
![Bustle](../../../images/2024/january/20/5-1.jpg)

Then, I was on the highway.
![Pedestrian road](../../../images/2024/january/20/5-2.jpg)

And I was here.
![Margo City, front](../../../images/2024/january/20/5-3.jpg)

Here is a floor guide for you foodies.
![Floor guide](../../../images/2024/january/20/5-5.jpg)

It is a small-to-medium-sized shopping mall. For no reason, I had no intention to document the inside of the mall, so I leave it to you guys to do that. What I can tell right now is that it doesn't have a landmark I can admire. Currently, the atrium is used for car showcase (not my niche).

But I had to get something inside this shopping mall. Luckily, I found Popeyes inside. Jakarta doesn't have too many Popeyes and I cannot recall an outlet close enough to go or even order online.

I ordered a set of buttermilk chicken strips, mashed potato, and an ice cream cone. I usually have less to say about fast food outlets since most of you are already familiar with that, so skim this breakdown.

And also a KOI sugar-free tea for my drink.

### Bonus

Oh, there is another mall (more like a plaza) called Depok Town Square across Margo City Mall. I went inside a bit because of this supermarket. This supermarket was a hype back then when I was a child. As of now, I never saw any inside Jakarta and Bangka. What a great day it was when it competes with other supermarkets.

## 14:00 - 15:00
### Lotte Mall Jakarta

Still too early to went home. I decided to go to add another destination to my itinerary. To start, I went back to Pondok Cina Station via a recently-opened apartment nearby.

I have to make sure that the train will stop at Tebet Train Station.
![Route to Tebet](../../../images/2024/january/20/6-1.jpg)

It took 30 minutes or more to take this picture.
![Tebet station](../../../images/2024/january/20/6-2.jpg)

Afterwards, I walked to find a bus stop. You might need to ask someone for a guide since there are no signs, but I assure you it will not take your time too much (I should record the procedure later).

They will know instantly where to board if you tell them a bus with an ID of 6D. Once again, you need your prepaid cards and it should be no more than 5K IDR for this trip.
![Bus with an ID of 6D](../../../images/2024/january/20/6-3.jpg).

After boarding, pay attention to this. You start at `Stasiun Tebet`. You have to stop at `Lotte Mall Kuningan 1`. The bus will not wait if there are no passengers going in or out.
![Route for 6D](../../../images/2024/january/20/6-4.png)

On arriving, I saw this majestic statue. I know what you are thinking right now and I am waiting for the balls joke.
![A Statue](../../../images/2024/january/20/6-5.jpg)

Also take a look.
![Lotte Mall Jakarta, outside](../../../images/2024/january/20/6-6.jpg)

There is also nothing special inside beside this hands below which are supposed to be a handprint of famous South Korean K-Popers I guess?
![Handprint](../../../images/2024/january/20/6-7.jpg)

The atrium was not worth my phone memory, so I let it pass. Nothing too special inside. Yet another ordinary mall with a bit of South Korean gimmick. I spent a lot of time inside walking with no clear objective.

## 16:30 - 18:00
### Aftermath

I boarded the same 6D bus to `Gelora Bung Karno Stadium`. After arriving there, I decided to walk from the bus stop to Senayan Park mall. I visited that mall long time ago at the opening. I wanted to see the differences as of today.

In a yet classic Neuron move, I took a walk from Gelora Bung Karno to Senayan Park Mall. A journey might be an understatement as I have to travel around the huge national stadium. Here is a screenshot of Google Maps as a quantitative measurement.
![Should be approximately 45 to 50 minutes since I walk faster and I take shortcuts](../../../images/2024/january/20/7-1.png)

Nothing changed in Senayan Park as of now. At this point, I was feeling tired to even document this trip. In a nutshell, I walked for no good reason and bought a cup of iced coffee listed below.

I closed my trip by taking a Gojek trip (another Grab-like service native to Indonesia) since my feet deserved a rest now.

## Closing

Well, that's pretty much it. I hope you enjoy my blogging first attempt. Thank you and cya on my next trip ðŸ˜ƒ

Neuron needs some rest so he can write this blog.
