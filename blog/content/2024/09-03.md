So I went to this restaurant that I accidentally saw on Google Maps while scouring area from Gramedia. I went to the palce and let's just day that this restaurant is... colorful enough

First things first, I love the interior. It gives me a blend of middle-eastern restsurant although this is not what I expect because middle eastern restaurant supposed to have LOTS of carpets. I mean A F-ING LOT

Fo context, they offer 3 kinds of seats, VIP room, floor room, and chairs. For floors, they offer 6-12 people for one room and VIP (VIP needs 1.5M minimum order tho). For chairs, they can fit 4-10 people depending on your seat.

The waitresses is so kind and helpful. They are morte than happy to answer my que3stion about the restaurant and they even offer me their buffett onRamadan which I will attend on this month. Will post it below. They might need more training on the food because let's just day that the food here is so foreign with forteign names with no description. They even aware of thius when I ask them. Revamping the design of the menu is necessary for me.

Caveat: I don't eat lamb due to my health issue so I mainly order their chicken hehe.

Ok let's jump to the food
Oh lord it is so frahggrant especially the Fasolia (beans with tomato paste and soup)
