# Halo Halo Bandung üëã

Hello, internet and transit bois and gurls!
First, congratulations to my Muslim friends for finally reaching the last day of Ramadan. Any good deeds that you guys did will contribute to the entire society hehe.
Be happy and prepare yourself for Eid Al-Fitr :).

Fun fact, Indonesia is a Muslim-Majority country with the 2nd largest Muslim pops in the world (the 1st spot was taken recently by Pakistan), so Eid Al-Fitr is a huge deal. I get an entire week of holiday from my workplace. Sure, I can still go to places yet to be visited by me inside Jakarta. However, in this case, I decided to go a bit far from Jakarta.

There were multiple considerations until I landed on this decision, which is:
1. I never hop into their new and shiny public transportation system. It is called Whoosh or Bandung-Jakarta High-Speed Rail. This train shortens the trip from Jakarta to Bandung and vice versa from 2 hours and 30 minutes into a measly 30 minutes of ride (if you don't account their feeder train).
2. I never stepped foot onto Lembang, their touristy highland region.
3. I want to try and review their transportation system, especially their traditional microbuses.
4. Why not? I have an entire week of holiday. I would not waste my holiday just to travel inside Jakarta only lol.

Well, those are very legitimate justifications for my travel, right? I have one more justification. I want to see if I can survive inside Bandung with no Uber or equivalent. I also want to see if I can survive alone since I only travel solo.

Great, I would go to Bandung for 3 days. Without further ado, I bought a round-trip High-Speed Rail for 300K each trip and booked my hotel for 2 nights for 340K per night.

Well, that was already 1280K IDR spent. It was a lot I can say. Remember the sayings. Money can come later, but time and experience might not come soon.

After the purchase, I kinda slacked off and packed my things on D-1 of my trip

### April 9th. Good Morning ‚òÄÔ∏è

Morning. My trip was scheduled at 9:47 AM and waking up at 6 AM was a great decision. After preparing my drinking water and checking up on things, I locked up my apartment door, marking the start of a long-range solo journey.

I already vowed to not use any Uber service so I would go using only public transportation or using my feet.

The high-speed train is stationed at Halim station, which is integrated with LRT Jabodebek, which is also integrated with Transjakarta. I already surveyed the route a day before. At first, I would try to transit into their LRT station at Dukuh Atas. After much more careful planning and research, here is what I come up with:

### Better be too early than be too late

Why? Something unexpected might happen. There might be unexpected closed lines or technical difficulties. Remember, rail-based transportation systems are mostly strict with their timetables. A minute late means a ticket is wasted. Yet, I admit that I was too pessimistic about the travel, but I digress

So, I am here, inside the train station. Saying that this is an average train station is underwhelming. It proudly resembles an airport with a high ceiling, wide corridor, sleek and futuristic design, and modern boarding pass system that can be either be printed or not.
