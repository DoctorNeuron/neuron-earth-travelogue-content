# LRT Jakarta for beginners

So, you have already learned a lot about Transjakarta? If not, you can read about that just by navigating using the sidebar ðŸ‘ˆ.

...

Ok here we go. If you, as Jakartans, often stumble across the integration map of Jakarta, you might notice something on the upper-right side of the map. There is a small line that connects `Pegangsaan Dua` and `Velodrome` dots.

Well, that is gonna be the topic of this article, but first, some visuals hehe.

Enough for the visuals. Now time for you to read

So, LRT Jakarta is a light-rail transport system that is intended to accommodate the demand for public transportation in Jakarta. Instead of asphalt roads, they have railways. Instead of rubber wheels, they have steel wheels.

It is currently operational with more stops on construction. From my personal experience, it was a fun ride with chilling temperatures and cold seats because of the materials (metal).

## History and current state

History lesson, guys!

So, LRT Jakarta has been proposed since 2015 and it began its construction in June 2016. The purpose of this was to be the next-generation transportation system for the last 2018 Asian Games that was held in Jakarta (and Palembang).

But obviously it was too optimistic, so LRT Jakarta never went into Asian Games sadly
